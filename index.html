      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a first year student at the University of Toronto who is studying
        Computer Science. I began programming rather recently, but have
        accumulated experience with Python, C++, HTML, and CSS, and am eager to
        learn much more now that I've discovered this passion for computer
        science. In particular, I am currently interested in further refining my
        skills in HTML and CSS, and to begin learning JavaScript to become more
        knowledgeable as a front-end developer.

            I first became interested in front-end web development thanks to my
            experience in CalHacks 8.0. I managed to rapidly piece together bits
            of HTML and CSS together during this event, but sought to fully
            solidify my knowledge by learning the basics, as well as more
            advanced concepts, and so, after watching countless tutorials, I
            finally decided to put what I learned so far into practice in this
            project.

          /></a>
          <p>
            Having become more proficient at JavaScript and becoming interested
            in front end web development, I decided to complete the Shopify
            Technical Challenge to create a web application that used a NASA API
            to access various images, display them on the web application, with
            the ability for users to scroll down and see the pictures with
            descriptions, titles, and dates, as well as to be able to like them.
            Despite having had no previous experience with API's and Jquery, I
            managed to create a functional web app meeting the given
            requirements.
