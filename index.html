        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> I'm a first year student at the University of
            Toronto who is studying Computer Science. I began
            programming rather recently, but have accumulated experience
            with Python, C++, HTML, and CSS, and am eager to learn much
            more now that I've discovered this passion for computer science. In particular,
            I am currently interested in further refining my skills in HTML and CSS, and to
            begin learning JavaScript to become more knowledgeable as a front-end developer.

                <p>I first became interested in front-end web development thanks to my experience in CalHacks 8.0. I
                    managed to rapidly piece together bits of HTML and CSS together during this event, but sought to
                    fully solidify my knowledge by learning the basics, as well as more advanced concepts, and so, after
                    watching countless tutorials, I finally decided to put what I learned so far into practice in this
                    project.</p>

                <p>I worked individually to develop a simulation of Conway's Game of Life for my programming class in
                    Grade 12. I planned out the necessary functions to analyze the conditions of the grid (live cells
                    and neighbour cells), to execute the rules of the simulation, and to print the grid, and then
                    implemented this plan and programmed the project.</p>
