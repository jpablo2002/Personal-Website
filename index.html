      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a first year student at the University of Toronto who is studying
        Computer Science. I am passionate about learning and, after individually learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, have set out to become more
        knowledgeable as a front-end developer through learning React, and also have begun to venture into back-end development with Node.js.

            After individually learning JavaScript basics through an online
            course, I sought to test my skills on the given project to create a
            game following certain requirements. I created the game given the
            guidelines from the course, as well as implementing some additional
            features, including a rules overlay, a dark/light mode switch, and
            making the web app responsive to different screen sizes. I
            implemented previous knowledge of CSS and HTML with my newfound
            knowledge of JavaScript basics to create a functional web
            application.

          <h2>Spacestagram Web App</h2>
          <a
            href="https://spacesta-gram.herokuapp.com/"

          <p>
            I created a web application that used a NASA API
            to access various images and display them on the web application. Users can scroll down and see the pictures with
            descriptions, titles, and dates, as well as like them.
            Initially, I had no previous experience with API's and Jquery, and made API 
            calls in the front-end, exposing the API key to the client, but realizing the security 
            issues with this, I later learned Node.js and Express basics to make a back-end with a server to handle requests 
            to render images.
